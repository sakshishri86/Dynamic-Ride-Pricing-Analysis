# Dynamic Ride-Pricing Analysis 

### A Data-Driven Approach to Optimize Ride-Hailing Fares


This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the factors influencing dynamic pricing for ride-hailing services. The goal is to move beyond simple duration-based fares and build a predictive model that suggests optimal prices in real-time.

The entire analysis and model are presented through an interactive web application built with **Streamlit**, allowing users to see how changing different variables can affect ride prices.

## Project Goal

The primary objective is to build a dynamic pricing model that incorporates multiple features to predict optimal fares for rides in real-time. The model must consider factors such as:
*   Demand and supply patterns
*   Customer loyalty and historical data
*   Location and time-based variables
*   Vehicle type and ride characteristics

---

##  Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is the "Dynamic Pricing Dataset" available on Kaggle. It includes various features like number of riders, drivers, vehicle type, customer loyalty status, and historical ride costs.
